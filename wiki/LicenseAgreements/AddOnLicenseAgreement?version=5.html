              offered for sale or for free use to the public ("Products") by
              the Licensee, provided that the Software is not the main
              component of such Products and such Products do not provide for
              the Software to be directly accessed and utilised in its own
              right.

        2.2   The Licence shall not entitle the Licensee to have access to the

              to create the same.

        2.3   Notwithstanding clause 2.1 the Licensee acknowledges that to make
              use of the Software the Licensee will need to have installed on
              the Equipment a current version of:

              2.3.1  the standard libRocket software which can be acquired from
                     [3]www.librocket.com;

              2.3.2  the Boost Python software which can be acquired from

    3.  Licence Term

        3.1   The Licence shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall
              continue until terminated in accordance with the provisions of
              this Agreement ("Term").

        3.2   Under no circumstance will the Licensee be entitled to grant a
              sub-licence in respect of the Licence or any part of the Licence
              or otherwise deal with its rights and obligations in respect of
              the Licence.

    4.  Support and Maintenance Services Term

        4.1   The Support and Maintenance Services shall commence on the
              Commencement Date and shall continue until the end of the Term.

    5.  Payment

        5.1   In the event that the Licensee uses the Software only for their
              own personal use or where the Products are distributed for free
              with no intention of gaining revenue through in-game advertising,
              subscription fees, or any other method, or used as promotional
              material, the Licensee will not be required to pay a Licence Fee
              to the Licensor but in return for the benefit the Licensee
              receives from using the Software the Licensee acknowledges that
              they will at all times still be bound by the terms of this
              Agreement.

        5.2   In the event that the Licensee incorporates the Software into
              Products, but such Products are sold in Very Low Volume, the
              Licensee will only be required to pay a Licence Fee of two
              hundred and fifty United States dollars ($50.00 USD).

        5.3   To qualify for the Licence Fee exception pursuant to clause 5.1
              or the Licence Fee outlined in clause 5.2, the Licensee must also
              ensure that:

              5.3.1  they are an individual or partnership and not a registered
                     company;

              5.3.2  the Project to which the Licence is to apply produces
                     Products that are of a shareware or hobby type nature; and

              5.3.3  they obtain the approval of the Licensor that the Project
                     to which the Licence is to apply comes within the terms of
                     clauses 5.1 or 5.2 as applicable and clauses 5.3.1 and
                     5.3.2.

        5.4   In the event that the Licensee incorporates the Software into
              Products which are sold in any volumes greater than Very Low Volumes
              the Licensee will be required to pay a Licence Fee of three thousand
              United States dollars ($250.00 USD).

        5.5   It is the Licensee's responsibility to ensure they have paid any
              applicable Licence Fee provided for in clauses 5.2 and 5.4 prior to
              making any use of the Software. Once paid the Licence Fee is
              non-refundable and the Licensor may terminate or suspend any Licence
              granted pursuant to this Agreement immediately on notice to the
              Licensee in the event any applicable Licence Fees due as defined in
              clauses 5.2 and 5.4 are unpaid and the Licensee will also indemnify
              the Licensor on demand for any direct and indirect costs of any
              nature whatsoever reasonably incurred by the Licensor in the course
              of securing the payment of any such unpaid Licence Fees.

        5.6   The Licensee shall pay the Licence Fee to the Licensor by way of
              credit card payment in the manner provided for via the Website.

        5.7   The Licence Fee is exclusive of any applicable Taxes including
              without limitation Goods and Services Tax ("GST") pursuant to the
              Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

        5.8   Notwithstanding clause 5.7 in the event that the Licensee is or
              becomes liable to pay or otherwise account for any Taxes, the payment
              of any amounts due under this Agreement will be adjusted to ensure
              that after the payment or accounting for of such Taxes the Licensor
              will receive the original amount that was due to it under this
              Agreement.

    6.  Delivery

        6.1   The Licensee shall download the Software from the Website.

    7.  Support and Maintenance Services

        7.1   During the Term the Licensor shall upon receipt of a Support Request
              provide the Licensee with the following Support and Maintenance
              Services by email in the following manner:

              7.1.1  Where an Error occurs the Licensee shall supply in writing to the
                     Licensor a detailed description of the Error requiring Error
                     Correction and the circumstances in which it arose, and shall
                     submit sufficient material and information to enable the Licensor
                     to duplicate the Error, following which the Licensor will provide
                     Error Correction in respect of the Error.

             7.1.2  Exclusions:

                    a) The Licensor shall be under no obligation to provide Support and
                       Maintenance Services in respect of:

                       i)   any defects or errors resulting from any modifications or
                            customisation of the Software made by any other person other than
                            the Licensor;

                       ii)  incorrect or unauthorised use of the Software or operator error
                            where these are defined as use or operation not in accordance
                            with the Documentation;

                       iii) any fault in the Equipment or in any programs used in
                            conjunction with the Software;

                       iv)  any defects or errors caused by the use of the Software on or
                            with any Equipment which is not approved in writing by the
                            Licensor or in conjunction with any other software which is not
                            approved in writing by the Licensor;

                       v)   any software or programs other than the Software;

                       vi)  any other of the Licensee's computer hardware, other equipment,
                            or any data feeds or external data; and

                       vii) the Licensee's failure to install and use upon the Equipment in
                            substitution for the previous release any new release of the
                            Software which includes updates or bug fixes in respect of the
                            Licensee's version of the Software within 90 days of such new
                            release of the Software being available for download from the
                            Website.

        7.2   The Licensor will respond to any Support Request by email within 48
              hours of its receipt and will attempt to provide the required Support
              and Maintenance Services within the same time period.

        7.3   In addition to making use of the Support and Maintenance Services
              provided for in clauses 7.1 and 7.2 the Licensee is also entitled to
              make use of the Forums on such the terms and conditions as are
              specified on the Website from time to time in respect of use of the
              Forums.

        7.4   Notwithstanding clauses 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, the Licensee acknowledges
              that in the event they are not required to pay a Licence Fee as
              provided for by clause 5.1, the Licensee will not be entitled to make
              use of the Support and Maintenance Services as described in clauses
              7.1 and 7.2 but will be entitled to make use of the Forums as
              provided for by clause 7.3.

    8.  New Releases

        8.1   During the Term the Licensor shall notify the Licensee by email,
              where the Licensee has registered on the Website to receive such
              notification, of any new release of the Software that is available
              for download from the Website.

        8.2   Notwithstanding clause 8.1, although the Licensee will be entitled to
              download any new releases of the Software as part of the Support and
              Maintenance Services, for the avoidance of doubt the Licensee will
              not be entitled to download and use any later version of the Software
              without paying a further applicable Licence Fee as defined in clauses
              5.2 and 5.4 in respect of that new version of the Software.

        8.3   In the event of any confusion as to whether a new release of the
              Software is actually a new version of the Software the Licensor's
              decision shall be final.

        8.4   The Licensor may from time to time, acting entirely at its own
              discretion, make such modifications to the current release of the
              Software as shall ensure that the current release conforms to any
              legal requirements or change of legislation. In the event that the
              Licensor acting reasonably does not believe that it is technically
              possible or commercially justifiable for it to make such
              modifications then the Licensor shall be entitled to terminate this
              Agreement on 30 days written notice to the Licensee. Where the
              Licensor does make modifications to the current release of the
              Software ("Modified Software") in accordance with the terms of this
              Agreement, the Licensor shall make such Modified Software available
              for download from the Website. The Licensee shall be required to as
              soon as reasonably possible adopt such Modified Software. Failure by
              the Licensee to adopt such Modified Software within 90 days of any
              such new release of the Software being made available for download
              from the Website, shall entitle the Licensor to terminate this
              Agreement immediately on written notice to the Licensee.

        8.5   Any new release of the Software or Modified Software adopted by the
              Licensee shall become the current release and the provisions of this
              Agreement shall apply accordingly.

    9.  Licensee's Obligations

        9.1   The Licensee shall operate the Software in accordance with the
              Specification and Documentation.

    10. Restrictions on Alterations

        10.1  If the Software within the Licensee's control pursuant to the
              Licence is modified or altered by the Licensee, the Licensee will
              fully indemnify the Licensor against all liability which may be
              incurred by the Licensor if such modifications or alterations
              infringe any Intellectual Property Rights of a third person or
              otherwise cause the Licensor to suffer loss, damages or expense.

        10.2  The Software within the Licensee's control pursuant to the
              Licence remains the property of the Licensor in all respects.

    11. Security and Control

        11.1  The Licensee shall during the continuance of the Licence effect
              and maintain security measures in accordance with accepted
              industry standards to safeguard the Software from access or use
              by any unauthorised person.

    12. Proprietary Rights

        12.1  The Product Materials and the Intellectual Property Rights of
              whatever nature in the Product Materials (excluding any third
              party rights in respect of Third Party Software) are and shall
              remain the property of the Licensor.

        12.2  The Licensee shall notify the Licensor immediately if the
              Licensee becomes aware of any unauthorised use of the whole or
              any part of the Product Materials by any person.

        12.3  The Third Party Software at all times remains the property of the
              applicable third party and the Licensee's use of such Third Party
              Software is at all times governed by the provisions of any
              applicable licence relating to any such Third Party Software.

    13. Intellectual Property Rights

        13.1  The Licensee acknowledges that the Licence granted pursuant to
              clause 2 does not grant any transfer of title or ownership to the
              Licensee of any Licensor's Intellectual Property Rights including
              without limitation in the Product Materials. The Licensee's right
              to use the Licensor's Intellectual Property Rights as provided
              for in this Agreement will cease upon the termination of this
              Agreement or as otherwise provided for in this clause 13.

        13.2  The Licensee acknowledges that the grant of the Licence or any
              other terms of this Agreement do not in any way confer any right
              or licence upon the Licensee to use, exploit or otherwise utilise
              any rights relating to the Licensor's Intellectual Property
              Rights other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

        13.3  The Licensee agrees not to represent in any way that it has any
              title, right or interest in the ownership of the Licensor's
              Intellectual Property Rights nor do anything which might be
              contrary to the rights or interest of the Licensor in its
              Intellectual Property Rights nor seek to apply to register in its
              own name or that of any third party any part of the Licensor's
              Intellectual Property Rights and will assist the Licensor in any
              application to register any such Intellectual Property Rights
              belonging to the Licensor at the cost of the Licensor.

        13.4  The Licensee agrees with the Licensor that it will notify the
              Licensor in writing as soon as practicable of any infringement,
              suspected infringement or alleged infringement relating to the
              Licensor's Intellectual Property Rights which comes to its
              knowledge provided that the Licensee will be deemed to have
              knowledge of any infringement, suspected infringement or alleged
              infringement if such infringement would have come to the
              Licensee's knowledge but for any negligence or wilful misconduct
              on the part of the Licensee.

        13.5  In the event that proceedings are brought or threatened by a
              third party against the Licensee or the Licensor, alleging that
              the Licensee's use of the Product Materials constitutes an
              infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights, the
              Licensor may at its option and at its own expense conduct the
              defence of such proceedings. As requested by the Licensor the
              Licensee shall provide all necessary co-operation, information
              and assistance to the Licensor in the conduct of the defence of
              such proceedings.

        13.6  In the circumstances provided for in clause 13.5, but also where
              the Licensor acting entirely at its own discretion believes that
              there is a reasonable likelihood that infringement may currently
              exist or is likely to occur, the Licensee agrees with the
              Licensor that it will permit the Licensor, acting entirely in the
              Licensor's discretion to;

              13.6.1  modify, alter or substitute the infringing or potentially
                      infringing part of the Product Materials, at the Licensor's expense
                      in order to avoid the infringement or potential infringement; or

              13.6.2  procure for the Licensee the authority to continue with the use and
                      possession of the infringing or potentially infringing part of the
                      Product Materials.

        13.7  If the remedies set out in clause 13.6 above are not in the
              Licensor's opinion reasonably available, then the Licensor shall be
              entitled to terminate the Licence and this Agreement immediately on
              written notice to the Licensee at which point the Licensee shall
              destroy all copies of the Product Materials within its possession and
              provide a written certificate from one of the Licensee's directors to
              the Licensor that such copies have been destroyed provided that the
              Licensor shall be entitled to enter upon the Licensee's premises to
              repossess any copies of the Product Materials in the possession,
              custody or control of the Licensee not returned or destroyed as
              provided for above.

        13.8  The Licensee acknowledges that the Licensor will have no obligation
              to indemnify the Licensee against any damages, costs and losses
              incurred by the Licensee whether direct or consequential (including
              but without limitation any economic loss or other loss of turnover,
              profits, business or goodwill) in connection with any proceedings
              bought by a third party against the Licensee alleging that the
              Licensee's use of the Product Materials constitutes an infringement
              of that third party's Intellectual Property Rights.

        13.9  The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor against any loss, costs,
              expenses, demands or liability, whether direct or indirect, arising
              out of a claim by a third party pursuant to clause 13.5 where:

              13.9.1  the claim arises from:

                      a) use of the Product Materials in combination with any equipment or
                         programs where such use is not authorised by the terms of this
                         Agreement or otherwise approved by the Licensor;

                      b) use of the Product Materials in a manner or for a purpose not
                         specifically provided for by this Agreement or authorised by the
                         Licensor;

                      c) modification or alteration of the Product Materials by the
                         Licensee or any third party on behalf of the Licensee; and

                      d) any transaction entered into by the Licensee relating to the
                         Product Materials without the Licensor's prior consent in writing
                         which is not otherwise authorised by the terms of this Agreement;
                         or

              13.9.2  the ability of the Licensor to defend the claim has been prejudiced
                      by the failure of the Licensee to comply with any requirements of
                      clauses 13.4, 13.5 or 13.6.

        13.10 The Licensee acknowledges that the Licensor is in no way liable to
              the Licensee in respect of any liability arising from the Licensee's
              use of any Third Party Software and the Licensee agrees to indemnify
              the Licensor on demand in the event of any liability suffered by the
              Licensor arising from the Licensee's use of the Third Party Software.

    14. Warranties

        14.1  To the fullest extent permitted at law, the Licensor:

              14.1.1  disclaims all warranties with respect to the Software, either
                      express or implied, including but not limited to any implied
                      warranties relating to quality, fitness for any particular purpose
                      or ability to achieve a particular result;

              14.1.2  makes no warranty that the Software is error free or that use of
                      the Software will be uninterrupted and the Licensee acknowledges
                      and agrees that the existence of such errors shall not constitute a
                      breach of this Agreement; and

              14.1.3  does not give any warranty in respect of the Third Party Software.

        14.2  The Licensee agrees that its sole remedy in respect of any
              non-conformance with any warranty that can not be excluded pursuant
              to clause 14.1 is that the Licensor will remedy such non-conformance
              (either by itself or through a third party) and if, in the Licensor's
              reasonable opinion, it is unable to remedy such non-conformance, the
              Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Licence and this
              Agreement immediately on written notice to the Licensee at which
              point the Licensee shall destroy all copies of the Product Materials
              within its possession and provide a written certificate from one of
              the Licensee's directors to the Licensor that such copies have been
              destroyed provided that the Licensor shall be entitled to enter upon
              the Licensee's premises to repossess any copies of the Product
              Materials in the possession, custody or control of the Licensee not
              returned or destroyed as provided for above.

        14.3  The Licensee will not disable or alter the display of the Software
              logo, as such is incorporated into any Products or generally
              displayed as a result of the use of the Software.

    15. Liability

        15.1  Except as provided for in clauses 13.9, 15.2, 15.3, 15.5 and 15.6
              and to the greatest extent permitted at law, under no
              circumstances will either party ("the first party"), its
              employees or its agents be liable to the other party ("the second
              party") in contract, tort, equity, statute, regulation or
              otherwise for any loss, damage, costs, legal costs, professional
              and other expenses of any nature whatsoever incurred or suffered
              by the second party, or by any other third party, whether direct
              or consequential (including but without limitation any economic
              loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business or goodwill)
              arising out of any dispute or contractual, tortuous or other
              claims or proceedings bought by the second party or which are
              alternatively bought against the second party as a result of the
              second party's breach of this Agreement.

        15.2  Clause 15.1 shall not exclude any liability of the first party to
              the second party which arises from:

              15.2.1  wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the first
                      party;

              15.2.2  where the Licensee is the first party, any act or omission by any
                      persons to whom the Licensee is permitted to disclose Information
                      (as defined in clause 16.1) as set out in this Agreement, which, if
                      done or omitted to be done by the Licensee, would be a breach of
                      the Licensee's obligations under this Agreement,

              and in respect of which the first party will indemnify the second party.

        15.3  In the event that any limitation or provision contained in this
              Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason and
              the first party becomes liable for loss or damage that would
              otherwise have been excluded, to the greatest extent permitted at
              law, and also in respect of any liability pursuant to clause 15.2,
              the first party's maximum liability to the second party under the
              Agreement shall be limited to an amount equivalent to the Licence Fee
              paid by the Licensee pursuant to this Agreement.

        15.4  Notwithstanding clause 15.1, to the greatest extent permitted at law,
              the parties agree that the first party shall not be liable to the
              second party in contract, tort, equity, statute, regulation or
              otherwise for any loss, damage, cost, legal costs, professional and
              other expenses of a consequential nature (including but without
              limitation any economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits,
              business or goodwill).

        15.5  Notwithstanding clauses 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4 the liability of
              the Licensee to the licensor shall not be limited in respect of any
              liability arising from the Licensee's breach of the Licensor's
              Intellectual Property Rights or any third party's Intellectual
              Property Rights.

        15.6  The parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in
              this clause 15 are reasonable in the light of all the circumstances.

        15.7  Where the Licensee is obtaining the Product Materials and Support and
              Maintenance Services for business purposes the Licensee agrees the
              Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 does not apply.

        15.8  The parties agree that to the greatest extent permitted at law the
              Sale of Goods Act 1908, the United Nations Convention on Contracts
              for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and the Sale of Goods
              (United Nations Convention) Act 1994 will not apply to this
              Agreement.

    16. Confidential Information

        16.1  The Licensee undertakes, except as provided below, to treat as
              confidential and keep secret all information marked
              'confidential' or which may reasonably be supposed to be
              confidential, including, without limitation, information
              contained or embodied in the Product Materials, the Specification
              and other information supplied by the Licensor to the Licensee
              (in this Agreement collectively referred to as 'the Information')
              with the same degree of care as the Licensee employs with regard
              to the Licensee's own confidential information of a like nature
              and in any event in accordance with best current commercial
              security practices, provided that, this clause shall not extend
              to any information which was rightfully in the possession of the
              Licensee prior to the commencement of this Agreement or which is
              already public knowledge or becomes so at a future date
              (otherwise than as a result of a breach of this clause).

        16.2  The Licensee shall not without the prior written consent of the
              Licensor divulge any part of the Information to any person
              except:

              16.2.1  to the Licensee's employees and then only to those employees to
                      whom it is necessary to make such disclosure in order for the
                      Licensee to meet its obligations under this Agreement;

              16.2.2  to such other parties as may be reasonably necessary to enable the
                      Licensee to meet its obligations under this Agreement;

              16.2.3  to the Licensee's solicitors, insurers, accountants and auditors; and

              16.2.4  where such disclosure is required, pursuant to any law, regulation,
                      court order or valid government department or agency legal
                      requirement, provided that the Licensee must:

                      a) promptly and if practicable before making the disclosure, notify
                         the Licensor of that fact and identify the Information required to
                         be so disclosed so that if practicable in the circumstances a
                         protective order or other appropriate remedy may be sought; and

                      b) disclose only the minimum Information required to comply with the
                         applicable law or order.

        16.3  The Licensee undertakes to ensure that persons and bodies referred to
              in clause 16.2 are made aware before the disclosure of any part of
              the Information that the same is confidential and that they owe a
              duty of confidence to the Licensor.

        16.4  The Licensee shall promptly notify the Licensor if it becomes aware
              of any breach of confidence by any person to whom the Licensee has
              divulged all or any part of the Information and the Licensee shall
              give the Licensor all reasonable assistance in connection with any
              proceedings which the Licensor may institute against such person for
              breach of confidence.

        16.5  The foregoing obligations as to confidentiality shall remain in full
              force and effect notwithstanding any termination of the Licence or
              this Agreement.

        16.6  The Licensor shall be entitled to identify the Licensee as a licensee
              of the Products in the Licensor's publicity materials.

        16.7  If the Licensor authorises the Licensee to disclose any Information
              to any person the Licensee agrees at the request of the Licensor
              prior to such disclosure to have such person execute an
              acknowledgement to the effect that the Information is disclosed to
              that person in confidence.

    17. Termination

        17.1  Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately by notice in
              writing to the other if the other:

              17.1.1  commits a material breach of this Agreement which is not capable of
                      remedy; or

              17.1.2  commits a breach of this Agreement which is capable of a remedy,
                      and such breach is not remedied within 14 days of receipt by the
                      other, of a notice from the innocent party identifying the breach
                      and requiring its remedy; or

              17.1.3  is unable to pay its debts or is deemed to be, or enters into
                      liquidation (other than with the prior written agreement of the
                      other party for the purpose of effecting a reconstruction or
                      amalgamation in such manner that the company resulting from such

        31.3  Where there is a dispute, the aggrieved party shall notify the other
              party in writing of the nature of the dispute, with as much detail as
              possible about the deficient performance of the other party. A
              representative from senior management of each of the parties
              ("representatives") shall meet in person or communicate by telephone
              within 5 business days of the date of the written notification in
              order to reach an agreement about the nature of the deficiency and
              the corrective action to be taken by the respective parties.

        31.4  If the dispute pursuant to clause 31.3 cannot be resolved within 10
              business days of the date of the written notification provided for in
              clause 31.3, or if the agreed upon completion dates in any written
              plan of corrective action are exceeded, the parties will refer the
              dispute to a single arbitrator to be chosen by the parties or, if
              they cannot agree, chosen by the President of the New Zealand Law
              Society, or the President's nominee and such arbitration will be
              conducted in New Zealand in accordance with the Rules in Schedules 1
              and 2 of the Arbitration Act 1996.

        31.5  The parties must always act in good faith and co-operate with each
              other to promptly resolve any dispute.

        31.6  The arbitrator will fix the procedures and time frames for the
              arbitration if the parties cannot agree.

        31.7  The parties must continue to comply with their obligations under this
              Agreement during the dispute resolution process.

        31.8  This clause will not apply to:

              31.8.1  a dispute arising in connection with any attempted re-negotiation
                      of this Agreement; or

              31.8.2  any application by either party for urgent interlocutory relief.

        31.9  If the parties cannot resolve the dispute by the procedure set out
              above, the parties shall irrevocably submit to the exclusive
              jurisdiction of the courts of New Zealand for the purposes of hearing
              and determining any dispute arising out of this Agreement.

        31.10 Each party recognises that the other party's business relies upon the
              protection of its Intellectual Property Rights and that in the event
              of a breach of Intellectual Property Rights, the other party will be
              caused irreparable damage and such other party may therefore be
              entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief in order to prevent
              a breach or threatened breach of its Intellectual Property Rights.

        31.11 Notwithstanding clause 31.1 to 31.7 and clause 31.9, the parties
              agree that:

              31.11.1  the Licensor shall have the right to sue to recover any amounts
                       owing to it in any jurisdiction in which the Licensee is operating
                       or has assets; and

              31.11.2  in the event of any breach or potential breach of its Intellectual
                       Property Rights the Licensor shall have the right to sue for breach
                       of its Intellectual Property Rights (whether in connection with
                       this Agreement or otherwise) in any country where it believes that
                       infringement or a breach or potential infringement or breach of
                       this Agreement relating to its Intellectual Property Rights is or
                       is likely to take place.

                                   SCHEDULE 1

                        Specification and Functionality

   Goal

   Provide a framework for constructing, displaying, and interacting with
   user interfaces in a C++ application.

   Overview

   Interfaces are defined in Rocket Markup Language (RML), a format based on
   HTML, and Rocket Cascading Style Sheets (RCSS), a format based on CSS. The
   RML specifies the content of the interfaces, the RCSS specifies how the
   content will be displayed.

   Based on the rules specified in the RCSS, each document (which is roughly
   equivalent to a webpage in web terminology, or a window in desktop
   terminology) has its child elements automatically laid out. The layout
   engine will detect when changes occur to the content or styling and
   re-layout when necessary.

   Elements have event hooks which can be used to send events back to the
   application.

   Templates for documents can be created from an RML file. New documents can
   read from the template and add their own content.

   Dynamic data can be handled by a datagrid or a dataselect, by fetching
   their contents from a data source and automatically respond to any changes
   in the data.

   libRocket's functionality can be extended by creating custom decorators to
   render elements in a specific way, by creating a custom element, by taking
   advantage of hooks in the XML parser, or by setting custom logging, file,
   render and system handlers.

   A visual run-time debugger is provided with libRocket.
