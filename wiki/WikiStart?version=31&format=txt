<p class="quote"><em>
This is a quick video of a lightweight game engine I'm getting together.
Horde3D rendering, libRocket GUI, and Lua for scripting.

<p class="quote"><em>
The libRocket integration was just finished. It's really a great UI library (HTML/CSS based, provides automatic handles, scrolling windows, etc.). I was also very impressed by the way which it generates geometry to be rendered and passes it to an application provided function/class. That made it fairly unobtrusive to implement.

<h2>Kong switches to libRocket</h2>
<p>SpaceDude sent word that the freeware 3d shooter has now integrated libRocket into his freeware game <a href="http://www.konggame.co.uk/">Kong</a>.</p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.konggame.co.uk/"><img style="float:right;" src="/chrome/site/images/kong.jpg" width="259px" height="194px" alt="Kong" /></a>
<p style="padding-top:50px;padding-left:25px;padding-right:25px;"><em>I now have a GUI which is easy to maintain and doesn't contain much boilerplate code if any.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:right;padding-right:300px;">- Martin Sherburn (Leader Programmer)</p>
<div style="clear: both"></div>
</div>
<p>Here's the offical description:</p>
<p class="quote">Kong is a freeware top-down shooter game featuring monkeys with a thirst for blood in a full 3D environment. The rules are simple, pick up as many health/armor packs and weapons as you can before blowing your enemies into smithereens. The game currently features three game modes including deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag with plans to introduce a number of new game modes. Computer controlled bots are provided as target practise but the real fun comes from playing in multiplayer over a local area network or the internet.

<ul>
   <li>Cross platform architecture (Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, ...).</li>
   <li>Dynamic layout system.</li>

   <li>Runtime visual debugging suite.</li>
   <li>Easily integrated and extensible with Python scripting.</li>
</ul>
	
<p class="intro">Extensible:</p>

   <li>Decorator engine allowing custom application-specific effects that can be applied to any element.</li>
