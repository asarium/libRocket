=== Methods ===

Events have a single Lua method, ''StopPropagation()'', which interrupts the event propagation if allowed by the event (ie, if it is interruptible).


=== Event Parameters ===

The ''Event.parameters'' property is implemented as as a [wiki:documentation/LuaManual/ProxyTables proxy table] in regards to the C++ interface with Lua; indexed by string only.
