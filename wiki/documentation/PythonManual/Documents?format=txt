== Interface ==

Documents derive from elements, so inherit their [wiki:documentation/PythonManual/Elements#Interface interface]. The document-specific interface is similar to the C++ interface; refer [wiki:documentation/C++Manual/Documents there] for the full functional documentation.

=== Properties ===

|| '''Python property''' || '''Brief description''' || '''Equivalent C++ methods''' ||
|| ''context'' || Retrieves the document's context. || ''GetContext()'' ||
|| ''title'' || Gets / sets the document's title. || ''GetTitle()'', ''SetTitle()'' ||

=== Methods ===

The following methods are exported from the C++ interface.

|| '''Python method''' || '''Brief description''' ||
|| ''CreateElement()'' || Creates an element by tag name. ||
|| ''CreateTextNode()'' || Creates a text element. ||
|| ''Close()'' || Closes the document and destroys all child elements. ||
|| ''Hide()'' || Hides the document. ||
|| ''PullToFront()'' || Pulls to the document to the front of others with a similar z-index. ||
|| ''PushToBack()'' || Pushes to the document behind others with a similar z-index. ||
|| ''Show(flags = FOCUS)'' || Shows the document, optionally with focus flags. ||

The flags available for the ''Show()'' function are the same as the C++ function. The flags are referenced in Python as:
 * ''NONE''
 * ''FOCUS''
 * ''MODAL''
