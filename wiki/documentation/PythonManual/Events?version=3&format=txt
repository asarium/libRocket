|| ''current_element'' || The current element in the event propagation. || ''GetCurrentElement()'' ||
|| ''target_element'' || The element the event was originally targeted at. || ''GetTargetElement()'' ||
|| ''type'' || The type of the event. || ''GetType()'' ||
|| ''parameters'' || Dictionary style container of all the parameters in the event || ''GetParameters()'' ||
