= Building FreeType for iOS =

The only dependencies libRocket has is on the [http://www.freetype.org/ FreeType] library. The library has build configurations for most platforms, but unfortunately not iOS. This document describes how to build libfreetype.a as a universal binary for iOS and the Mac (i386, x86_64, arm6, arm7).

NOTE: You can download a prebuilt version of these libraries from the [/download download] section.

== Download the Source ==

Download the latest freetype sourcecode from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/ sourceforge].

Open a terminal and extract the archive:
{{{
$ tar -jxf libfreetype-2.4.2.tar.bz2
$ cd libfreetype-2.4.2
}}}

== Compiling the library ==

We have to compile the library four times, once for each architecture.

'''i386'''
{{{
$ CC="g++ -arch -i386" ./configure;make
}}}

This forces configure to use the i386 architecture and build the library. The built library is located at objs/.libs/libfreetype.a. We copy this to our top level folder and build the next architecture.

{{{
$ cp objs/.libs/libfreetype.a libfreetype-i386.a
}}}

Similar build setup for x86_64, notice the addition of ''make clean'', we want to completely remove the i386 code.

'''x86_64'''
{{{
$ CC="g++ -arch -i386" ./configure;make clean;make
$ cp objs/.libs/libfreetype.a libfreetype-x86_64.a
}}}
