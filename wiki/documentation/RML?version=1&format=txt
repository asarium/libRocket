RML is based loosely around [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ XHTML 1.0] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/ HTML 4.01], however element names are (mostly) open-ended in RML and can be used in any way that is logical for your application. All documents follow strict XML1.0 specification and where possible all Rocket elements follow their HTML equivalent.

RML maintains the core components of HTML4, including CSS and scripting (via the Python plugin). It provides a number of basic elements including input fields, radio buttons and check boxes as well as more complex enhancements such as templates and datagrids.
