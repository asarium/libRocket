= Loading Fonts =

TrueType and OpenType fonts can be loaded into Rocket by the application. Rocket has no default font, so at least one font must be loaded before text can be rendered.

To load a font, call one of the ''LoadFontFace()'' functions on ''Rocket::Core::FontDatabase''. The simplest of these takes just a file name:

{{{
// Adds a new font face to the database. The face's family, style and weight will be determined from the face itself.
// @param[in] file_name The file to load the face from.
// @return True if the face was loaded successfully, false otherwise.
static bool LoadFontFace(const EMP::Core::String& file_name);
}}}

This function will load the font file specified (opening it through the file interface). The font's family (the string you specify the font with using the 'font-family' RCSS property), the style (normal or italic) and weight (normal or bold) are all fetched from the font file itself. Rocket will generate the font data for specific sizes of the font as required by the application.

If you need to override the family name, style or weight of the font, use the more complex ''LoadFontFace()'':

{{{
// Adds a new font face to the database, ignoring any family, style and weight information stored in the face itself.
// @param[in] file_name The file to load the face from.
// @param[in] family The family to add the face to.
// @param[in] style The style of the face (normal or italic).
// @param[in] weight The weight of the face (normal or bold).
// @return True if the face was loaded successfully, false otherwise.
static bool LoadFontFace(const EMP::Core::String& file_name,
                         const EMP::Core::String& family,
                         Rocket::Core::Font::Style style,
                         Rocket::Core::Font::Weight weight);
}}}

''style'' is one of Rocket::Core::Font::STYLE_NORMAL or STYLE_ITALIC; ''weight'' is one of Rocket::Core::Font::WEIGHT_NORMAL or WEIGHT_BOLD.

The italic and bold versions of a font are selected with the 'font-weight' and 'font-style' RCSS properties.

In the following example, the font file at 'data/trilobyte.ttf' is loaded and registered with Rocket with the family name, style and weight settings specified in the file itself.

{{{
Rocket::Core::FontDatabase::LoadFontFace("data/trilobyte.ttf");
}}}

In this example, the font file is loaded with overrides for the name, style and weight.

{{{
Rocket::Core::FontDatabase::LoadFontFace("data/trilobyte_b.ttf",
                                         "Trilobyte",
                                         Rocket::Core::Font::STYLE_NORMAL,
                                         Rocket::Core::Font::WEIGHT_BOLD);
}}}

These fonts would be specified in RCSS with the following rules:
{{{
body
{
    font-family: Trilobyte;
}

strong
{
    font-weight: bold;
}
}}}
