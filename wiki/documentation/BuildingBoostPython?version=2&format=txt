= Building Boost::Python =

This page describes how to build Boost::Python for use with libRocket. This describes how to build against a debug version of Python on the Windows platform.

== Directory Structure ==

The default libRocket configurations assume there is a support folder at the same directory structure level as the main "rocket" folder.

{{{
D:\development
  rocket
    Include
    Source
    Build
    ...
  support
    boost
    freetype
    python
    lib
}}}

== Building Python ==

This is straight forward, get the latest source code for Python (Python 2.7 at the time of writing). Open the solution file under PC/VS8.0 (VS will ask you to update the solution).

Build a debug and release version of the python. Copy python27.dll and python27_d.dll into support/lib directory.

== Build Boost::Python ==

Boost uses its own custom ''bjam'' build system. Download boost (1.44 at the time of writing) and a prebuilt copy of bjam.exe. Next we need to create a custom bjam-config.jam file that tells bjam where our copy of python is. This file needs to be placed in your home directory ('''echo %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%''' in a command prompt will give you this path. Its ''C:\Users\<username>\'' on Windows Vista/7)
{{{
using python : 2.7 : D:\\development\\support\\python\\pcbuild\\python ;
using python : 2.7 : D:\\development\\support\\python\\pcbuild\\python_d
  : # includes
  : # libs
