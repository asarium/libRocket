= Building Boost::Python =

This page describes how to build Boost::Python for use with libRocket. This describes how to build against a debug version of Python on the Windows platform.

== Directory Structure ==

The default libRocket configurations assume there is a support folder at the same directory structure level as the main "rocket" folder.

{{{
C:\development
  rocket
    Include
    Source
    Build
    ...
  support
    boost
    freetype
    python
    lib
}}}

== Building Python ==

This is straight forward, get the latest source code for Python (Python 2.7 at the time of writing). Open the solution file under PC/VS8.0 (VS will ask you to update the solution).

Build a debug and release version of the python. Copy python27.dll and python27_d.dll into support/lib directory.
