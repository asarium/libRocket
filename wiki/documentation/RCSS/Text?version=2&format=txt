= Text =

== Alignment: the 'text-align' property ==

''text-align''
|| ''Value:'' || left | right | center ||
|| ''Initial:'' || left ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || block-level elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || yes ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

This property affects how inline boxes within a line box are aligned. Values have the following meanings:

 left::
   The row of inline boxes are aligned against the left edge of the line box.
 right::
   The row of inline boxes are aligned against the right edge of the line box.
 center::
   The row of inline boxes are aligned in the centre of the line box.

Note that the 'justify' value is not yet supported in RCSS.

== Decoration ==

=== Underlining: the 'text-decoration' property ===

''text-decoration''
|| ''Value:'' || none | underline ||
|| ''Initial:'' || none ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || all elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || yes ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

Values have the following meaning:

 none::
   Any text generated by this element has no additional decoration.
 underline::
   Any text generated by this element has an underline, with a thickness and position specified by the font.

The colour of any decoration is the same as the font colour. Note that 'overline' and 'line-through' is not yet supported in RCSS.

=== Text shadows: the 'shadow' font effect ===

Instead of using the CSS-standard 'text-shadow' property, text-shadowing is implemented in libRocket using the more generic font effect system. Below is an example of how to specify a shadow for an element of text.

{{{
/* Specify a grey text shadow on primary headings. */
h1
{
    darken-font-effect: shadow;
    darken-offset: 2px 2px;
    darken-color: grey;
}
}}}

== Whitespace: the 'white-space' property ==

''white-space''
|| ''Value:'' || normal | pre | nowrap | pre-wrap | pre-line ||
|| ''Initial:'' || normal ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || block-level elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || yes ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

This property defines how whitespace (any spaces, end-lines, carriage-returns and tabs) are processed in sections of text. Values have the following meanings:

 normal::
   Sequences of whitespace are collapsed down to single spaces. Lines are broken as necessary to fit line boxes. Line breaks in the source are ignored.
 pre::
   Sequences of whitespace are preserved. Lines are only broken where line breaks are present in the source.
 nowrap::
   Sequences of whitespace are collapsed. Lines are not broken.
 pre-wrap::
   Sequences of whitespace are not collapsed. Lines are only broken where line breaks are present in the source.
 pre-line::
   Sequences of whitespace are collapsed. Lines are broken to fit line boxes or where line breaks are present in the source.
