== Cursors: the 'cursor' property ==

''cursor''
|| ''Value:'' || <string> | auto ||
|| ''Initial:'' || auto ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || all elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || yes ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

This property defines the cursor to display while the mouse is hovering over the element. Values have the following meanings:

 auto::
   The default cursor is used.
 string::
   The RML document loaded as a cursor and with <string> as a title is used as a cursor. If none exists, the default cursor is used.

Cursors can be loaded into Rocket using the Rocket::Core::Context::LoadCursor() function.

== Drag & drop: the 'drag' property ==

The 'drag' property is a new property, not shared by CSS. It controls the generation of events as the mouse cursor begins a drag over an element (ie, clicks the left mouse button and moves the mouse), drags over elements (moves the mouse with the button depressed) and finishes a drag, or 'drops', an element over another.

''drag''
|| ''Value:'' || none | drag | drag-drop | block ||
|| ''Initial:'' || none ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || all elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || no ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

Values have the following meanings:

 none::
   If the mouse begins a drag over this element, the element is not dragged and does not generate any drag messages. However, it does not prevent an ancestor element from being dragged.
 drag::
   If the mouse begins a drag over this element, the element will begin spawning drag messages. However, no messages will be directed to other elements relating to the drag or the eventual drop.
 drag-drop::
   If the mouse begins a drag over this element, the element will begin spawning drag messages. Messages will also be directed to over elements if the dragged element is dragged over them.
 block::
   If the mouse begins a drag over this element, the element is not dragged and neither is any ancestor element.

== Tab index: the 'tab-index' property ==

The 'tab-index' property is introduced for RCSS. It controls the generation of a ''tab order'', which is an ordered list of elements within a document that gain input focus in turn as the 'tab' key is pressed.

''tab-index''
|| ''Value:'' || none | auto ||
|| ''Initial:'' || none ||
|| ''Applies to:'' || all elements ||
|| ''Inherited:'' || no ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

Values have the following meanings:

 none::
   The element is not part of the tabbing order.
 auto::
   The element inserts itself into the tabbing order in a location relative to its order in the element hierarchy.

Future versions of Rocket may have more advanced features for determining the tab order of elements.
