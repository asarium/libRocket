= Tiled Vertical decorator =

The 'tiled-vertical' decorator can render three images, or subsections of images, vertically across an element. One image is placed on the top edge, another on the bottom edge, and the last is stretched or repeated across the middle.

''top-image-src''
|| ''Value:'' || <string> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || not defined ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''top-image-s-begin'', ''top-image-t-begin''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 0 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''top-image-s-end'', ''top-image-t-end''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 1 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

These properties specify the top image. They behave similarly to the properties in the 'image' decorator.

''bottom-image-src''
|| ''Value:'' || <string> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || not defined ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''bottom-image-s-begin'', ''bottom-image-t-begin''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 0 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''bottom-image-s-end'', ''bottom-image-t-end''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 1 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

These properties specify the bottom image. They behave similarly to the properties in the 'image' decorator. If only one side is defined, the other will be the vertical mirror of it. At least one side must be defined.

''center-image-src''
|| ''Value:'' || <string> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || not defined ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''center-image-repeat''
|| ''Value:'' || stretch | clamp-stretch | clamp-truncate | repeat-stretch | repeat-truncate ||
|| ''Initial:'' || stretch ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''center-image-s-begin'', ''center-image-t-begin''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 0 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''center-image-s-end'', ''center-image-t-end''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 1 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

These properties specify the centre image. They behave similarly to the centre properties in the 'horizontal-tiled' decorator.
