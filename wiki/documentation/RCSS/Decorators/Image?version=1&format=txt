= Image Decorator =

The 'image' decorator can render a single image or a rectangular subsection of a single image. It has the following properties:

''image-src''
|| ''Value:'' || <string> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || not defined ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

This property defines the name (and, for file sources, the relative path) of the source image.

''image-s-begin'', ''image-t-begin''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 0 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

''image-s-end'', ''image-t-end''
|| ''Value:'' || <number> | <length> | <percentage> ||
|| ''Initial:'' || 1 ||
|| ''Percentages:'' || N/A ||

These values specify the texture coordinates to use when rendering the image. Values have the following meanings:

 number::
   Expected to be a floating-point number from 0 to 1, this is the raw texture coordinate.
 length::
   Expected to be expressed in 'px' units and from 0 to the length of the appropriate texture axis. The texture will be rendered from (for -begin) or to (for -end) this pixel.
 percentage::
   The texture will be rendered from (for -begin) ot to (for -end) this far across the appropriate texture axis.

''image-s''[[BR]]

''image-t''[[BR]]
A shorthand property for setting ''image-t-begin'' and ''image-t-end''.

''image''[[BR]]
A shorthand property for setting ''image-src'', ''image-s-begin'', ''image-t-begin'', ''image-s-end'' and ''image-t-end''.
