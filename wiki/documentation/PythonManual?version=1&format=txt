The Python interface to Rocket has been designed to resemble Javascript as closely as possible. Due the nature of the language, this is more possible in Python than C++.

The functionality of Rocket is described fully in the [wiki:documentation/C++Manual C++ Manual]; this manual defines the Python interface to the Rocket objects described there. Not all aspects of Rocket are accessible from Python; for example, custom decorators can only be created in C++. However the vast majority is accessible, enabling you to easily and efficiently develop the functionality of your documents.
