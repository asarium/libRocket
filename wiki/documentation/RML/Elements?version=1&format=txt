= Elements =

Rocket has no prior understanding of XML elements other than the built-in [wiki:documentation/RML/ElementIndex element types]. 

When parsing a tag Rocket will look up custom elements associated with the tag name and fall back to a generic element. Very few custom elements are required as most of the power in Rocket comes from styling elements with [wiki:documentation/RCSS RCSS] to produce the desired layout.

The user is encouraged to follow standard HTML guidelines where possible to improve readability across the community. For more information on setting up Rocket to emulate HTML4 see [wiki:documentation/RML/HTML4StyleSheet Appendix: HTML4 Style Sheet].
