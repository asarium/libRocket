= RML Style Sheets =

Styles can be included in an RML document in three ways: included from an external style sheet, declared in the header, or declared inline inside a specific tag.

== External Style Sheets ==

Style sheets are included from an external source with the ''LINK'' tag. See [wiki:documentation/RML/Documents#LINKElement Link Element].

== Header Style Information ==

RCSS can be included directly inside the header, with the ''STYLE'' tag.

''No attributes''[[br]]

== Inline Style Declaration ==

RCSS can be declared directly inside an element with the ''style'' attribute.

''Attributes''[[br]]
'''style = [wiki:documentation/Glossary#Styleinformation style]''' [wiki:documentation/Glossary#CaseInformation (CN)]
  This attribute specifies a list of RCSS properties to be applied to the current element.
