= Planned Features =

Based on discussions in the [http://forums.librocket.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=337 forums], the following are planned features for libRocket.

== Sooner ==

 * Investigate switching the XML parser to [http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/ RapidXML] for speed
 * Make the STL configurable (this is important for Custom Memory Allocators later too)

== Later ==

 * Add support to render a document to texture
 * Send all allocs and frees through the SystemInterface, allowing developers to manage memory better
 * Make contexts thread safe, so each context can run in its own thread without affecting the other

== Some Day ==
 * Address the global element transparency issues. Some elements don't currently support transparency, due to HTML spec, but I think its worth coming up with a way to allow this.
 * Expose more of the font system, maybe making it a plugin, so that you're not required to use TrueType fonts.
 * Allow text strings to be rendered at different angles, not just horizontal
